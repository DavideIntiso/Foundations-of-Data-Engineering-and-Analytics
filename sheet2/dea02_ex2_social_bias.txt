Exercise 2

a)

As general problems there could be sparsity, which makes it easier to analayse the more frequent
elements and harder for the rare elements.
Furthermore the content could be incomplete, corrupted or containing errors, what is called noise.
There are also some general data bias that exist in processing social data:
- Population biases: Systematic distortions in demographics or other user characteristics between
 a population of users.
- Behavioral Biases: Systematic distortions in user behavior across platforms or contexts, or across
 users represented in diﬀerent datasets.
- Content Production Biases: Behavioral biases that are expressed as lexical, syntactic, semantic,
 and structural diﬀerences in the content generated by users.
- Linking Biases: Behavioral biases that are expressed as diﬀerences in the attributes of networks
obtained from user connections, interactions or activity.
- Temporal Biases: Systematic distortions across user populations or behaviors over time.

Another problem with datasets is redundancy which means that values can occur more than one
times. In doing so these values can be identical or near identical.


b)

Again there are different types of biases:
- Functional biases: Biases that are a result of platform-speciﬁc mechanisms or aﬀordances, that is,
the possible actions within each system or environment.
- Normative biases Biases that are a result of written or unwritten norms and expectations of
acceptable patterns of behavior on a given online platform or medium.
- External biases). Biases resulting from factors outside the social platform, including considerations
 of socioeconomic status, ideological/religious/political leaning, education, personality, culture,
 social pressure, privacy concerns, and external events.

 Additionally it is possible that accounts are not individuals instead there are non-individual agents.
 For example organizations or bots.


c)
Yes there are two additional biases which occur during collecting and processing:
- Data collection biases: Biases introduced due to the selection of data sources, or by the way in
which data from these sources are acquired and prepared. The way in which the selection of
particular data sources affects the observations, and thus the research findings, can be referred
to as source selection bias.
Data processing biases: Biases introduced by data processing operations such as cleaning,
enrichment, and aggregation.
